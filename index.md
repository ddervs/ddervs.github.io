Hi, I'm Dan. I am currently working for the [J.P. Morgan AI Research lab](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/technology/artificial-intelligence). I recently finished a PhD in the [UCL Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/), supervised by [Prof Simone Severini](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucapsse/), embedded in the [CS Quantum](https://quantum.cs.ucl.ac.uk) group. I was in the second cohort of the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Delivering Quantum Technologies](www.uclq.org/centre-for-doctoral-training/). I've worked part-time as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Curvestone](https://www.curvestone.io/) and done an internship in the Data Science team at [Tesco](https://www.tesco.com) working on Operations Research. 

I'm interested in the following topics:

- Algorithms
- Graph Theory
- Optimisation (discrete and continuous)
- Multi-agent systems and games
- Machine Learning
- Quantum Computation


I really enjoy teaching, lecturing and scientific outreach.


I also program in various languages (check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ddervs)), mainly in `python`.
