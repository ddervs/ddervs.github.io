# About

Hi, I'm Dan. I'm a PhD student at the [UCL Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/), supervised by [Prof Simone Severini](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucapsse/), embedded in the [CS Quantum](https://quantum.cs.ucl.ac.uk) group. I am in the second cohort of the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Delivering Quantum Technologies](www.uclq.org/centre-for-doctoral-training/).

I'm interested in the following topics:

- Algorithms
- Quantum Computation
- Graph Theory
- Optimisation
- Machine Learning

I really enjoy teaching, lecturing and scientific outreach.


I also program in various languages (check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ddervs)), mainly `python`, `MATLAB` and `C++`. I am the webmaster for my research group's website, [https://quantum.cs.ucl.ac.uk](https://quantum.cs.ucl.ac.uk).

# Teaching

I try to involve myself in teaching at UCL as much as I can. These activities include:

- I demonstrate for the [`MATLAB` course](http://ucl-cs-grad.github.io/matlabgrad/) for the UCL Computer Science Department. This course is designed to help graduate students unfamiliar with programming to be able to carry out and analyse the experiments for their research using `MATLAB`.

- In March 2017, I gave a guest lecture for the Quantum Computation course in the [CDT in Quantum Technologies](www.uclq.org/centre-for-doctoral-training/) on the [*HHL algorithm*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithm_for_linear_systems_of_equations). This is a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations that *under certain conditions* is exponentially faster than any classical method. My typed notes can be found [here](https://github.com/ddervs/ddervs.github.io/tree/master/assets/pdfs/HHL.pdf).

# Outreach

I'm a big fan of communicating science to non-specialists. Here are some of the projects I've been involved with in public engagement.

## Talks

- In February 2017, I gave a talk to a group of A-level students at [Graveney School](http://www.graveney.org) in Tooting, London. The talk was a general introduction to Quantum Computation, titled *The Future of Computing in a Quantum Age*. The slides can be found [here](https://github.com/ddervs/ddervs.github.io/tree/master/assets/pdfs/Graveney_Talk.pdf).


## Quantum Secrets of Photosynthesis

My colleagues in [Alexandra Olaya-Castro's Group](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucapaol/index.html) in the Physics department at UCL have an outreach programme for their research, the [Quantum Secrets of Photosynthesis](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucapaol/outreach.html). They describe their what they do most elegantly:
>Our research aims to elucidate fundamental quantum principles underlying energy capture, transfer and conversion at the biomolecular level. 

In the summer of 2016, I volunteered at their exhibit for the [Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition](https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2016/summer-science-exhibition/), where we wowed the public with interactive displays illuminating how plants and bacteria use quantum mechanics to absorb and transfer energy more efficiently than thought possible.

In fact, the exhibition was such a success that it continued on to [Glastonbury Festival](http://glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/) the next year (2017). It was fun.
