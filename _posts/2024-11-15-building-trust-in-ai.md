short_description: This post explores how making AI models more transparent can build trust and improve decision-making. It introduces Linearised Additive Models (LAMs), which enhance the clarity of logistic models without sacrificing performance.

I have recently published a blog post on [AIHub.org](https://aihub.org/), titled [Building trust in AI: Transparent models for better decisions](https://aihub.org/2024/10/31/building-trust-in-ai-transparent-models-for-better-decisions/).

The post is a more digestible version of our recent paper, published at [IJCAI 24](https://ijcai24.org/), [Are Logistic Models Really Interpretable?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13427) by Danial Dervovic, Freddy Lécué, Nicolás Marchesotti and Daniele Magazzeni.

Hope you enjoy it.
